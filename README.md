## Description 

Homework assignment 13 Object Relational Mapping. I built a functional back end for an e-commerce site by using Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The database consisted of four models and were built using the Sequelize model structure. Associations were created between tables using a through model. All routes were tested using Insomnia Core.
